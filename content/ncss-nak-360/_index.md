      title: National Council of Social Service - Ngee Ann Kongsi 360 Panel Study
      text: |-
        The School of Humanities and Behavioural Sciences (SHBS) at SUSS, in collaboration with the National Council of Social Service (NCSS) and The Ngee Ann Kongsi (NAK), conducted a longitudinal survey to assess the experiences, activities and well-being of residents in 1,000 Singaporean households.

        All participants are interviewed face to face on their daily activities and experiences, to examine the time use of Singaporeans and how it is related to their well-being and quality of life. 

        The longitudinal study documents change over 3 years, quantifying economic conditions such as employment alongside contribution/value beyond monetary terms such as caregiving, social support and intergeneration transfers.
