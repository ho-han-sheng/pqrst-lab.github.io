To assess the frequency and intensity of arts engagement inclusive of active and passive engagements in arts, culture and heritage activities among Singaporean adults aged 50 and above, and examine the relationships between participatory art and holistic well-being.


Design
Cross-sectional stratified household survey.


Setting
All residential areas across Singaporeâ€™s Central, East, North, North-East and West Regions.


Participants
1067 community-dwelling, Singaporean older adults between the ages of 50 and 95 years were recruited.


Primary and secondary outcome measures
Respondents completed a self-reported questionnaire, consisting of standardised ad hoc items assessing the frequencies and durations of active and passive participatory arts engagement, as well as validated psychometric assessments on psychosociospiritual health including the primary outcome measure on quality of life, and the secondary outcome measures on physical, psychological, emotional, spiritual, and social well-being. sociodemographic information, as well as frequency and intensity of physical activity were also collected.


Results

Passive engagement (60%) and active engagement (17%) in the arts were associated with better holistic wellness and social support. Specifically, findings from the propensity score matching and independent t-test analyses revealed that adults aged 50 and above who passively engaged in arts and culture-related events experienced higher quality of life (
t
(728)=3.35, p=0.0008,
d
=0.25), perceived health (
t
(728)=2.21, p=0.0277,
d
=0.16) and sense of belonging (
t
(728)=2.17, p=0.03,
d
=0.16), as compared with those who did not. Moreover, those who actively engaged in participatory arts experienced greater quality of life (
t
(442)=3.68, p=0.0003,
d
=0.36), self-rated health (
t
(442)=2.59, p=0.0099,
d
=0.25), spiritual well-being (
t
(442)=3.75, p=0.0002,
d
=0.37), meaning in life (
t
(442)=5.03, p\textless0.0001,
d
=0.50) and sense of peace (
t
(442)=3.72, p
=
0.0002,
d
=0.36), as compared with those who did not actively engaged in the arts.



Conclusion
This study provided robust evidence to support a significant causal relationship between arts engagements and holistic well-being. Recommendations for art-based public health and elderly care research, practice and policy are discussed.},
